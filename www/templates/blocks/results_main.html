<div class="gww-middle">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here you can find the results of the tests that were performed to this day - the firepower of the hardware allows me to display only the results on the daily basis.</p>
				<p>Results view for the selected bundle displays the results from the data you have collected - but will not display anything if you haven't done any measurements. In this case you still have the data performed by everyone else - under each seperate test view.</p>
